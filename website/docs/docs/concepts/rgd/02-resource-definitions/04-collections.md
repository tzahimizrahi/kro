# Collections

By default, each resource definition (in `spec.resources`) creates exactly one
Kubernetes resource. This means the number of resources is fixed at design
time - if you need 5 worker Pods, you write 5 resource definitions.

Collections let you declaratively manage multiple similar resources from a
single definition. This is useful when the number of resources depends on
runtime data like availability zones, tenants, or worker counts.

kro provides the `forEach` field to turn any resource into a collection. The
field takes one or more iterators, and kro creates one resource for each element
(or combination of elements), keeping them in sync as the collection changes.

## Basic Example

This RGD uses `forEach` to create multiple Pods from a single resource entry:

```kro
apiVersion: kro.run/v1alpha1
kind: ResourceGraphDefinition
metadata:
  name: worker-pool
spec:
  schema:
    apiVersion: v1alpha1
    kind: WorkerPool
    spec:
      workers: "[]string"
      image: string

  resources:
    - id: workerPods
      forEach:
        - worker: ${schema.spec.workers}
      template:
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + worker}
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: app
              image: ${schema.spec.image}
```

When a user creates an instance with `workers: ["alice", "bob"]`, kro creates two
Pods - one for each worker. If the user later updates the list to
`["alice", "bob", "charlie"]`, kro creates a third Pod for "charlie".

## forEach Syntax

The `forEach` field is an array of iterators. Each iterator is a single-entry
map binding a variable name to an expression:

```kro
forEach:
  - region: ${schema.spec.regions}
```

Each map entry must have exactly one key-value pair:
- **Key**: The iterator variable name (available in your template expressions)
- **Value**: A CEL expression that **must evaluate to an array**

Arrays maintain their order, so resources are indexed in the same order as
elements appear in the source array - this ordering is deterministic and
predictable for naming and labeling purposes.

### Iterating Over Maps

If you have map (object) data, convert it to a sorted array first. Maps have
non-deterministic iteration order in Go, so converting to a sorted array ensures
consistent resource creation order:

```kro
# Given schema.spec.labels = {"app": "web", "env": "prod", "team": "platform"}
forEach:
  # Convert map keys to a sorted array
  - key: ${schema.spec.labels.map(k, k).sort()}
```

For ordering pitfalls and why this matters, see
[Map Gotchas and pitfalls](#map-iteration-order-is-not-deterministic)

## Iterator Variables

The variable name you specify becomes available in the template, holding the
current element:

```kro
- id: workerPods
  forEach:
    - worker: ${schema.spec.workers}  # ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]
  template:
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      # <instance-name>-alice, <instance-name>-bob, <instance-name>-charlie
      name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + worker}
```

To access the index, iterate over a range instead:

```kro
- id: workerPods
  forEach:
    - idx: ${lists.range(size(schema.spec.workers))}
  template:
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      # <instance-name>-0, <instance-name>-1, <instance-name>-2
      name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + string(idx)}
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: worker
          env:
            - name: WORKER_NAME
              value: ${schema.spec.workers[idx]}  # alice, bob, charlie
```

:::tip
Use descriptive iterator names that reflect what you're iterating over, like
`worker`, `region`, or `dbSpec` rather than generic names like `item` or `i`.
:::

### Resource Naming

Each resource in a collection must have a unique name. Always include the
iterator variable in `metadata.name` to ensure uniqueness:

```kro
- id: workerPods
  forEach:
    - worker: ${schema.spec.workers}
  template:
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      # Good: includes iterator variable for uniqueness
      name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + worker}
```

:::warning Unique Names Required
Resource names must be unique not just within the collection, but across all
instances and RGDs in the same namespace. Kubernetes identifies resources by
namespace + name + kind + apiVersion - if two resources share these, they
conflict.

Best practice: always include the instance name to avoid cross-instance
collisions:

```kro
# With regions: ["us-east", "us-west"] and tiers: ["web", "api"]
name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + region + '-' + tier}
# Creates: myapp-us-east-web, myapp-us-east-api, myapp-us-west-web, myapp-us-west-api
```

If you omit `schema.metadata.name`, two instances with the same iterator values
will overwrite each other's resources.
:::

## Multiple Iterators (Cartesian Product)

When you specify multiple iterators, kro creates resources for every combination
(cartesian product) of values:

```kro
- id: deployments
  forEach:
    - region: ${schema.spec.regions}  # ["us-east", "us-west"]
    - tier: ${schema.spec.tiers}      # ["web", "api"]
  template:
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      # Creates 4 deployments: myapp-us-east-web, myapp-us-east-api, etc.
      name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + region + '-' + tier}
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: app
              image: ${schema.spec.image}
              env:
                - name: REGION
                  value: ${region}
                - name: TIER
                  value: ${tier}
```

With `regions: ["us-east", "us-west"]` and `tiers: ["web", "api"]`, this creates
4 deployments covering all combinations.

### Combination Order

The first iterator is the outer loop, subsequent iterators are nested inside.
Resources are created in this order:

```yaml
# forEach:
#   - region: ["us-east", "us-west"]
#   - tier: ["web", "api"]

# Creates resources in order:
# 1. region=us-east, tier=web
# 2. region=us-east, tier=api
# 3. region=us-west, tier=web
# 4. region=us-west, tier=api
```

This order is deterministic as long as each iterator's source array has
deterministic order (arrays are ordered, maps are not - see
[Iterating Over Maps](#iterating-over-maps) if you need to iterate over map data).

:::important
If any iterator's collection is empty, zero resources are created. This follows
standard cartesian product behavior: `2 × 0 = 0`.
:::


## Collection Sources

The iterator expression must evaluate to an array. Arrays can come from various sources:

      metadata:
        name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-shard-' + string(shardNum)}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Referencing Collections

Other resources can reference a collection by its ID. The collection exposes
all created resources as an array, which you can use with CEL functions like
`map()`, `filter()`, and `all()`.

### In a Resource

Use CEL functions to aggregate collection data into a single resource:

```kro
- id: workerPods
  forEach:
    - worker: ${schema.spec.workers}
  template:
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + worker}
    # ...

- id: summary
  template:
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-summary'}
    data:
      podNames: ${workerPods.map(p, p.metadata.name).join(', ')}
      count: ${string(size(workerPods))}
```

### In Another Collection

One collection can iterate over another to create dependent resources:

```kro
- id: databases
  forEach:
    - dbSpec: ${schema.spec.databases}
  template:
    apiVersion: db.example.com/v1
    kind: Database
    metadata:
      name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + dbSpec.name}
    spec:
      storage: ${dbSpec.storage}

- id: backupJobs
  forEach:
    - db: ${databases}  # iterate over the collection
  template:
    kind: CronJob
    metadata:
      name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-backup-' + db.metadata.name}
    spec:
      schedule: "0 2 * * *"
      jobTemplate:
        spec:
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
                - name: backup
                  env:
                    - name: DB_HOST
                      value: ${db.status.endpoint}
```

### Dependency Behavior

Like references in templates, resource references in `forEach` expressions
create edges in the dependency graph. Any reference between a resource and a
collection - whether in the `forEach` expression or in the template - causes
kro to wait for the referenced collection to be fully reconciled and ready
(`readyWhen` resolves to true) before proceeding:

```kro
resources:
  # Collection A: creates multiple databases
  - id: databases
    forEach:
      - dbSpec: ${schema.spec.databases}
    template:
      kind: Database
      metadata:
        name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + dbSpec.name}
      # ...

  # Collection B: depends on Collection A
  # kro waits for ALL databases to be ready before creating backup jobs
  - id: backupJobs
    forEach:
      - db: ${databases}
    template:
      kind: CronJob
      metadata:
        name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-backup-' + db.metadata.name}
      # ...

  # Resource C: depends on Collection B
  # kro waits for ALL backup jobs to be ready before creating the summary
  - id: summary
    template:
      kind: ConfigMap
      metadata:
        name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-summary'}
      data:
        backupCount: ${string(size(backupJobs))}
```

## Readiness with Collections

For collections, `readyWhen` uses the `each` keyword for per-item readiness
checks. The collection is ready when **all** items pass **all** readyWhen
expressions (AND semantics):

```kro
- id: workerPods
  forEach:
    - worker: ${schema.spec.workers}
  readyWhen:
    - ${each.status.phase == 'Running'}  # Per-item check using `each`
  template:
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + worker}
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: ${schema.spec.image}
```

In this example, `workerPods` is only considered ready when **every** pod in the
collection has `status.phase == 'Running'`. Dependent resources wait for this
condition before proceeding.
:::important
If the collection is empty (zero items), it is considered ready.
:::

For empty-collection readiness, see
[Constraints & Gotchas](#constraints--gotchas) below.

:::tip
Without `readyWhen`, a collection is considered ready once all resources are
created. Add `readyWhen` when dependent resources need specific conditions to be
true, not just existence.
:::

## Conditional Collections

The `includeWhen` field operates on the collection as a whole. If the condition
evaluates to `false`, the entire collection is skipped - no resources are
created. You cannot use `includeWhen` to exclude individual items:

```kro
- id: backupJobs
  includeWhen:
    - ${schema.spec.backupsEnabled}  # all or nothing
  forEach:
    - dbSpec: ${schema.spec.databases}
  template:
    kind: CronJob
    metadata:
      name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-backup-' + dbSpec.name}
    # ...
```

To filter individual items from a collection, use `filter()` in the `forEach`
expression:

```kro
- id: backupJobs
  forEach:
    # Only iterate over databases that have backups enabled
    - dbSpec: ${schema.spec.databases.filter(d, d.backupEnabled)}
  template:
    kind: CronJob
    metadata:
      name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-backup-' + dbSpec.name}
    # ...
```

For the all-or-nothing behavior of `includeWhen`, see
[Constraints & Gotchas](#constraints--gotchas) below.

## Constraints & Gotchas

Collections are powerful but easy to misuse. Most issues come from identity
collisions, dimension explosion from cartesian products, or assumptions about
readiness and ordering. Use this section as a quick checklist when behavior
looks surprising.

### External References

A resource cannot use both `forEach` and `externalRef` — they are mutually
exclusive fields. However, external refs can act as collections on their own
by using `selector` instead of `name`. See
**[External Collections](./05-external-references.md#external-collections)**
for details on label-selector-based external collections.

### Dimension Explosion

Multiple iterators multiply the total number of resources. A small increase in
each dimension can produce a large cartesian product, which slows reconciliation
and increases cluster churn:

```text
3 regions × 5 tiers × 10 shards = 150 resources
```

Keep iterator lists bounded and avoid combining large dimensions unless you
intentionally want the expanded set.

### Collection Size Limit

Collections are limited to **1000 resources** per collection by default. If a `forEach`
expression or cartesian product would create more than the limit resources, the
reconciliation will fail with an error.

This limit helps prevent accidental resource explosion and protects cluster
performance. This limit is configurable through the CLI flag `--rgd-max-collection-size`
or the Helm value `config.rgd.maxCollectionSize`.

:::warning Deletion Limitation
Currently, collections that exceed this limit will get stuck during deletion. If you
accidentally create a collection larger than the configured limit, manual cleanup may
be required.
:::

### Collection Dimension Limit

Each resource is limited to **10 forEach dimensions** by default. If a resource
defines more forEach iterators than this limit, validation fails at RGD
processing time before any resources are created.

This prevents combinatorial explosion from deeply nested cartesian products.
This limit is configurable through the CLI flag `--rgd-max-collection-dimension-size`
or the Helm value `config.rgd.maxCollectionDimensionSize`.

### includeWhen Is Collection-wide

`includeWhen` applies to the entire collection. If it evaluates to `false`, the
whole collection is skipped and **no items** are created. It cannot be used to
filter individual items.

If you need per-item filtering, use `filter()` in the `forEach` expression
instead.

### Empty Collections Are Ready

An empty array produces zero resources. The collection is still considered
**ready**, because there are no items to wait on. This also applies to cartesian
products where any iterator is empty (`2 × 0 = 0`).

If you expect downstream resources to wait on actual items, ensure the
collection is non-empty or use additional conditions in `includeWhen`.

### Map Iteration Order Is Not Deterministic

Map iteration order in Go is randomized. If you iterate over map keys or values,
convert the map to a sorted array first to make resource ordering stable.
Unstable ordering can lead to noisy diffs and unexpected reconciliation churn.

For example:

```kro
# Given schema.spec.labels = {"app": "web", "env": "prod"}
forEach:
  - key: ${schema.spec.labels.map(k, k).sort()}
template:
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + key}
  data:
    value: ${schema.spec.labels[key]}
```

:::tip Prefer Arrays Over Maps
When designing your API schema, prefer arrays over maps. Arrays offer better
patching semantics (strategic merge patch), extensibility (items can grow new
fields), deterministic ordering, and more predictable tooling behavior (kubectl,
kustomize, helm).
:::

### Identity Must Include All Iterator Dimensions

Every iterator dimension must be represented in the resource identity. If any
dimension is omitted, distinct items can collapse to the same resource and
overwrite each other.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="namespaced" label="Namespaced Resources">

```kro
# region + tier must appear in name or namespace
metadata:
  name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + region + '-' + tier}
  # OR: namespace: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + region}
```

You can also split iterator dimensions across name and namespace:

```kro
metadata:
  name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + tier}
  namespace: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + region}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cluster-scoped" label="Cluster-scoped Resources">

```kro
# cluster-scoped resources have no namespace, so all iterator dimensions must
# be part of metadata.name
metadata:
  name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + region + '-' + tier}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Collection Labels Are Managed

kro-managed collection labels are part of the public API. Do not modify them
manually — changes will be reverted and can break collection bookkeeping.

## Exposing Collection Data in Instance Status

Status expressions can reference collections to compute aggregate values. This
lets you expose summary information about the collection in your custom
resource's status:

```kro
spec:
  schema:
    apiVersion: v1alpha1
    kind: WorkerPool
    spec:
      workers: "[]string"
    status:
      total: ${size(workerPods)}
      running: ${size(workerPods.filter(w, w.status.phase == 'Running'))}
      ready: ${workerPods.all(w, w.status.phase == 'Running')}

  resources:
    - id: workerPods
      forEach:
        - worker: ${schema.spec.workers}
      template:
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: ${schema.metadata.name + '-' + worker}
        # ...
```

## Collection Lifecycle

Collections automatically stay in sync with their source data. When the source
array changes, kro creates, updates, or deletes resources to match.

### Scaling Up

When items are added to the source array, kro creates new resources.  
Example: if `workers` changes from `["alice", "bob"]` to `["alice", "bob", "charlie"]`,
it creates one new pod for **charlie**.

### Scaling Down

When items are removed from the source array, kro automatically deletes the
corresponding resources.  
Example: if `workers` changes from `["alice", "bob", "charlie"]` to `["alice"]`,
it deletes the pods for **bob** and **charlie**.

This cleanup happens automatically through kro's applyset mechanism - orphaned
resources are pruned on each reconciliation.

### Empty Collections

An empty array results in zero resources - this is not an error:
for example, `workers: []` means no pods are created (the collection exists but is empty).

This is useful for optional features that can be enabled by adding items to an
initially empty array.

Empty collections are considered ready, since there are no items to wait on.

:::important
If any iterator in a cartesian product is empty, zero resources are created.
For example, `regions: ["us-east"]` × `tiers: []` = zero deployments.
:::

For more context on empty-collection behavior, see
[Constraints & Gotchas](#constraints--gotchas) above.

### Drift Detection

kro continuously reconciles collection resources to match the desired state. If
a resource is modified externally (drift), kro restores it:

```yaml
# 1. kro creates ConfigMap with data.prefix: "original"
# 2. Someone manually changes data.prefix to "MODIFIED"
# 3. kro detects the drift and restores data.prefix to "original"
```

This applies to all fields that kro manages. Fields added by other controllers
(not in kro's template) are preserved.

---

## How Collections Work

This section explains the internal mechanics for those who want to understand
what happens under the hood. You don't need this to use collections effectively.

When you add `forEach` to a resource, kro treats that resource block as a
template for multiple resources rather than a single one.

**At RGD validation time (static analysis)**, kro analyzes the `forEach`
expressions to determine the element types. If `schema.spec.workers` is
`[]string`, kro knows each iteration yields a string and types the iterator
variable accordingly. This enables [static type checking](../05-static-type-checking.md)
of expressions inside the template before any resources are created.

**At instance reconciliation time (runtime)**, when the reconciler reaches a
collection node in the dependency graph:

1. Evaluates each forEach CEL expression to get the current collections
2. Creates multiple resources - one per element (or combination)
3. Compares against existing resources and creates, updates, or deletes as
   needed
4. Evaluates `readyWhen` (if specified) across all collection resources before
   proceeding to dependent nodes

Each resource in the collection is tracked independently. If one resource fails
to reconcile, the others continue - kro doesn't require all-or-nothing success
within a collection.

:::note
In kro, each entry in `spec.resources` is a node in the dependency graph. A
collection (a resource with `forEach`) is also a single node in the graph - it
creates multiple resources at runtime, but dependencies treat it as one unit.
:::

## Collection Labels

kro automatically applies labels to each resource in a collection to track
membership and ordering. These labels are part of kro's public API and can be
used for querying or debugging:

| Label | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `kro.run/node-id` | The resource ID from the RGD | `workerPods` |
| `kro.run/collection-index` | Position in the collection (0-indexed) | `0`, `1`, `2` |
| `kro.run/collection-size` | Total number of items in the collection | `3` |
| `kro.run/instance-id` | UID of the instance that owns this resource | `a1b2c3...` |

These labels enable:
- **Querying**: Find all items in a collection with `kubectl get pods -l kro.run/node-id=workerPods`
- **Ordering**: Understand item position via `collection-index`
- **Debugging**: Trace resources back to their source instance and RGD

:::note
The combination of `instance-id` + `node-id` + `collection-index` uniquely
identifies each collection item. These labels are managed by kro - do not
modify them manually.
:::

See [Constraints & Gotchas](#constraints--gotchas) for label management notes.
